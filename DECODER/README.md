## Hi there!

### This is a first approach to sharing a simple project in a HDL, in this case Verilog. A 4:16 decoder (active in low outputs) connected to a nand gate is shown.


The premises are simple, and I will be explaining each step (as well as why i do anything in that way), to clarify my actions and to try that the people who is not in knowledge of the basis of Verilog can follow properly what I am building.

Considering the point of this, which is just showing some basic sintax, forms and capabilities of HDLs, i  will not go further with theory during the process, as for example, a decoder with active low outputs plugged into a nand gate is a way to represent a combinational logic function(that represents a combinational circuit).
