## Hi there!

### This is the first approach to sharing a simple project in Verilog. A decoder 4:16 (active in low outputs) connected to a nand gate.


The premises are simple, and i will be explaining each step (as well as why i do anything in that way), to clarify my actions and to try that the people who´s not in knowledge of the basis of verilog can follow properly what i´m doing.

Considering the point of this, which is just showing some basic sintax, forms and capabilities of HDLs, i  will not go further with theory during the process, as for example, a decoder with active low outputs plugged to a nand it´s a way to represent a combinational logic function(that represents a combinational circuit).
